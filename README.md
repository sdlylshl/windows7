<h1>Windows 7 Configuration Files</h1>

These are just some various configuration files I need to use when setting up my existing Windows 7 installation.
Got tired of recreating them, so now I'm finally doing the smart thing!

<h3>ChangeCapsToControl.reg</h3>

<p>This registry key entry will convert your Caps Lock key to an additional Control key in Windows 7.
This is tremendously useful for emacs users. Compatibility on other versions of windows has not been
tested, but feel free to let me know your experiences.</p>
